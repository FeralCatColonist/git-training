# Directions for Bitbucket

Since Bitbucket is the remote repository, we are not working with a local `branch`. Our `branch`, at this point,
lives exclusively on the remote repository, it is the remote `branch`. So this section will just show how to
delete the remote `branch`. 

Now that we understand how to work within Bitbucket, let's start from the beginning.

> - create a new `branch`
>     - it can be based on main or your other branch that was submitted as a pull request
>     - name it something like `jcarmona-branch-cleaning`
> - create a new file within the demo_06 directory
> - commit the change
> - push the change to Bitbucket
> - navigate to the **Branches** section of the repository within Bitbucket
> - find your new `branch`
>     - click the **...** in the **Actions** column
>     - click **Delete**

Again, because there is no local `branch` when working solely within Bitbucket, deleting the `branch` within
Bitbucket would conclude your cleanup operations.
