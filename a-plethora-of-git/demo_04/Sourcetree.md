# Directions for Atlassian Sourcetree

Open Sourcetree. Navigate to your current `branch` if needed.

> - in demo-02 we created a local `branch`
> - in demo-03 we commited a file to that local `branch`
>
> However, we did not create a remote counterpart of that `branch`. Meaning, that work only exists locally, on our
> workstation. We will perform a `push` operation against our local `branch`, creating a paired copy in the remote
> repository. The result is that we will have a copy of our `branch` locally and on our remote repository on Bitbucket. 

Highlight your most recent commit and click the **Push** button. A dialog box will appear:

- select your local `branch` by clicking the check box
    - the name of your remote `branch` will automatically populate
- click **Push**

> We can review that the operation was successful by navigating to the remote repository:
> 
> - https://bitbucket.org/some-tenant/git-training/src/main/
> 
> Click the drop-down button that says **main**, you will see the name of your `branch` you made locally:
> 
> - click your branch name to change to it
>     - notice this changes the bitbucket URL
> - navigate to the demo-03 directory and you'll find your *guest-book.txt* file

**You have officially pushed your first commit!**
