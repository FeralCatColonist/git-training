We have created a new file, *guest-book.txt*, and made a `commit` into the *demo-03* directory.
Next, we'll `push` our local `branch` changes to the remote `branch` in our repository.

## Choose Your Own Adventure
As always, while you can take an *all of the above* approach to see which style might suit you best, feel free
to skip around to the pathway that you might be most comfortable with.
