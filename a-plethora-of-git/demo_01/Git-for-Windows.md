Open Git Bash. Enter the following commands:

```bash
cd "the-path-to-your-directory"
git clone https://YOURNAMEHERE@bitbucket.org/some-tenant/git-training.git
```

This:

- changes the directory (folder) the bash terminal is pointed to
- git clones the repository from the URL into a new directory

The `git clone` URL can be retrieved from the repository homepage:

- clicking the Clone button
- clicking the copy icon

**You now have a local copy of the repository on your workstation.**
