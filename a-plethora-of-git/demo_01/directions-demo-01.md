This demo will really be the start of our epic adventure. An adventure that you get to choose!

## Choose Your Own Adventure
As always, while you can take an *all of the above* approach to see which style might suit you best, feel free
to skip around to the pathway that you might be most comfortable with. But like any dungeon adventure, we need
to enter the dungeon, erm, code lair. The fancy word/jargon here is **cloning the repository**. No false choices
here. All of these are real options without gotchas.
