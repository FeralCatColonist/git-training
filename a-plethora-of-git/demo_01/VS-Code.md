# Directions for Visual Studio Code

We have two options for creating a Git Clone with Visual Studio Code.

### With Bitbucket
On the repository's page within Bitbucket:

- https://bitbucket.org/some-tenant/git-training/src/main/

Click the `Clone` button on the top right of the page

- then click **Clone in VS Code**

Visual Studio Code will now open and the Command Palette will have a drop down

- select **Clone a new copy**

This opens the **Save As dialog box**, directions below

### With Visual Studio Code
Open Visual Studio Code. There should always be a "Welcome" tab and within it, a hyperlink for
"Clone Git Repository".

Clicking on that will open the Git Clone command in the Command Palette at the center top of the window. 
You can also access the git clone functionality by pressing `ctrl + shift + P`
- type `git clone`

Within the Command Palette, you'll enter the URL to `git clone` the repository:

- this is found in the git clone dialog box within bitbucket
- with a pattern like https://yourname@bitbucket.org/some-tenant/git-training.git

A **Save As dialog box** will appear, you will choose the base directory, a new directory will be
saved containing the respository. Afterwards, another dialog box will appear for options on opening
the new repository.

**You now have a local copy of the repository on your workstation.**
