Just like performing analyses in GIS, there are many ways for a professional to successfully utilize
git-based version control. The following presentation series will cover four main pathways:

- web-based using BitBucket
- client-based using Atlassian Sourcetree
- IDE-based using VSCode
- command-line using Git for Windows

## Choose Your Own Adventure
While you can take an *all of the above* approach to see which style might suit you best, feel free
to skip around to the pathway that you might be most comfortable with. This section of the demo will
ensure that you have appropriately downloaded all the tools necessary for the upcoming activities.

Bitbucket is a web-based solution and requires no specialized installations:

Git for Windows is **both** a standalone pathway and a **prerequisite** for Sourcetree and VSCode:
- [Directions for Git for Windows](Git-for-Windows.md)

Sourcetree is a desktop software purpose-built for GUI-based source code management:

Visual Studio Code is an IDE with the ability to interact with Git as one of its many features:
