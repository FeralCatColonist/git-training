Proceed to the shared software installation folder: `\\some-network-path`

The following is a step-by-step guide for the installation process:

### Note:
The recommendation is to have Git installed first. Without manually installing Git we will not have
control over many options that are required. Due to this, you'll need to proceed to the Git for
Windows installation how-to before continuing:
#### [Directions for Git for Windows](Git-for-Windows.md)
The following steps are assuming that Git for Windows has been successfully installed.
### Step 1: Launching the Installer
1. Double-click on the installer file `SourceTreeSetup-3.4.22.exe` (version number may vary)

### Step 2: Registration
Sourcetree requires registration with your current Bitbucket account, you'll need to already have
been given access to our Bitbucket. If you haven't already, ensure you browse to the following URL:

- **https://bitbucket.org/some-tenant**

If you don't have access, let us know and we'll send an invite to your organization email.

1. Sign into Bitbucket from a browser window
2. Click the icon on the right: Bitbucket
    - A browser window will automatically appear and authenticate you for the installation.
3. Click **Next**

### Step 3: Install Tools
At this screen there are two options for downloads, Git and Mercurial. We will only be using Git
which has already been installed.

1. Uncheck the option for Mercurial
2. Click **Next**

### Step 4: Preferences
This screen will automatically populate your first and last name and your email as configured within
Bitbucket.

1. Click **Next**

The Sourcetree program will open and show all the repositories owned by our organization.

### Step 5: Installation and Completion
A pop-up will appear asking if you would like to load an SSH key. This is something that you will
likely not utilize.

1. Click **No**
2. The installation is now complete
