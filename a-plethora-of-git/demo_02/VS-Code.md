# Directions for Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code. To open the repository you cloned in the previous module you can use the
**Open Folder...** link in the Welcome tab or you can right-click the VS Code icon on your taskbar
and select the respository from the recent folders.

You have a few options to create a new `branch`

- enter `ctrl + shift + p` to open the Command Palette
    - type `git branch` you can select **create branch...** or **create branch from...**
        - **create branch...** will create a branch from the currently active branch
        - **create branch from...** will allow you to select the branch you want your new branch based on
- on the bottom left of your VS Code window, there should be a git icon, that says `main`
    - left-click that area and the Command Palette will open pre-populated, the first two options are:
        - **create branch...** will create a branch from the currently active branch
        - **create branch from...** will allow you to select the branch you want your new branch based on

For the current demo, it does not matter which option you choose. For future work, it may be helpful to select
**create branch from**.

- select the `main` `branch`
- next let's give our new `branch` a name

> While we do not have standards at this point, our advice is to make the name descriptive in what you
> are trying to accomplish. A few examples:
> 
> - `build-locator-parcels`
> - `upgrade-geodatabase-automation`
> - `refactor-getpalsinfo-gp-tool`
> 
> The idea here is that if anyone stumbles upon your `branch` it should be clear as to its purpose.
> Also, the `branch` name is recorded in the logs and will appear when you `merge` your changes into
> main. 
> 
> A few notes, you:
> 
> - can use capital letters but those get forced down to lowercase
> - should prefer `-` over `_` since a `-` is both more legible and easier to type than a `_`
> - cannot use names longer than 62 characters, they are truncated (in bitbucket)
> 
> Fill out the `branch` name, since this is a training demo, you can use a pattern like:
> 
> - `jcarmona-git-demo`

- type in the name of the branch

**You've now created a new branch in the git training repository on your local workstation.**
