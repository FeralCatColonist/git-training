We now have a local copy of the repository on our workstation in most of these pathways.

## Choose Your Own Adventure
As always, while you can take an *all of the above* approach to see which style might suit you best, feel free
to skip around to the pathway that you might be most comfortable with. The next step is to create a new `branch`
where we will be directly editing our work. This demo covers that process.
