# Directions for Atlassian Sourcetree

We have two options for creating a `branch` with Atlassian Sourcetree.

### With Bitbucket
Follow the [Bitbucket directions](Bitbucket.md), at the final screen after you press **Create**,
there is an option to check out the new `branch` you just created in Sourcetree.
The Sourcetree software will pop-up, Click **Checkout**.

**You've now created a new branch in the git training repository on your local workstation.**

### With Sourcetree
Open Sourcetree. The software should have saved the previous state, *i.e. a tab with the main
repository open*. If it has not, you have a variety of options, you can:

- click the **+** sign in the tab bar to create a new tab, in that screen you should see the bookmark
created in the previous module, double-click it
- click **File**, then **Open...**, then navigate to the repository directory
- in your bookmark bar, it will heave the header **Local repositories**, right-click the repository
we cloned in the previous module, then click **Open**

We also have a variety of options to create a new `branch`:

- in the context ribbon, click the `branch` button
    - the branch dialog box appears
- enter the keyboard command `shift + ctrl + b`
    - the branch dialog box appears

> While we do not have standards at this point, our advice is to make the name descriptive in what
> you are trying to accomplish. A few examples:
> 
> - `build-locator-parcels`
> - `upgrade-geodatabase-automation`
> - `refactor-getpalsinfo-gp-tool`
> 
> The idea here is that if anyone stumbles upon your `branch` it should be clear as to its purpose.
> Also, the `branch` name is recorded in the logs and will appear when you `merge` your changes into
> main. 
> 
> A few notes, you:
> 
> - can use capital letters but those get forced down to lowercase
> - should prefer `-` over `_` since a `-` is both more legible and easier to type than a `_`
> - cannot use names longer than 62 characters, they are truncated (in bitbucket)
> 
> Fill out the `branch` name, since this is a training demo, you can use a pattern like:
> 
> - `jcarmona-git-demo`

In the branch dialog box:

- in the **New Branch** field, type in the name of your new `branch`
    - you do not need to change the other options
- click **Create Branch**

**You've now created a new branch in the git training repository on your local workstation.**
