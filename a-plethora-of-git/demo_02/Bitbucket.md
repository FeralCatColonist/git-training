# Directions for Bitbucket 

At the repository's main page, click on the blue **Create** button

- when the drop-down appears, select **Branch**

The Create branch page will now load. By default, the Type will be *Other*; however, take a moment
to scroll through the other types and notice how we can add descriptive information into the name
of the `branch`.

We will create a `branch` off of `main` but it is possible to create a `branch` from any other `branch`.

Next, you'll create a name for your new branch.

> While we do not have standards at this point, our advice is to make the name descriptive in what you
> are trying to accomplish. A few examples:
> 
> - `build-locator-parcels`
> - `upgrade-geodatabase-automation`
> - `refactor-getpalsinfo-gp-tool`
> 
> The idea here is that if anyone stumbles upon your `branch` it should be clear as to its purpose.
> Also, the `branch` name is recorded in the logs and will appear when you `merge` your changes into
> main. 
> 
> A few notes, you:
> 
> - can use capital letters but those get forced down to lowercase
> - should prefer `-` over `_` since a `-` is both more legible and easier to type than a `_`
> - cannot use names longer than 62 characters, they are truncated (in bitbucket)
> 
> Fill out the `branch` name, since this is a training demo, you can use a pattern like:
> 
> - `jcarmona-git-demo`

- click **Create**

**You've now created a new branch in the git training repository**. Since we're in Bitbucket we do
not need to check out the branch. What we'll do instead, is click the **Source** button on the top left,
then at the repository home page, click the button that says **main**, it will provide a drop-down menu
where you can select your new `branch`.
