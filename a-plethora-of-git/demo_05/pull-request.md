# Directions for Visual Studio Code

Open bitbucket to the remote repository:

- https://bitbucket.org/some-tenant/git-training/src/main/

On the left pane:

- click on the **branches** button
- select your `branch`
- click the **Create** hyperlink in the **Pull request** column

Alternatively, if you click on your `branch` name, this opens a new page:

- click the **Create pull request button**

This opens the pull request dialog box. By default, this will be populated with the content of all
the commits that you have made against this `branch`. Depending on how frequently you have committed
and how detailed your `commit` messages are this may be a rather large amount of text.

This is what others are going to see as part of the pull request. It is best to use this space to tell
the story of your code, what changes you've made, why, and any questions or commentary that might be
useful for the reviewer(s).

- the source branch should be pre-populated with your local `branch` and the destination `branch`
should be **main**
- click the checkbox under **Delete branch** this ensures the remote repository remains tidy
- click the **Create pull request** button

**You have officially made your first pull request!**
